##### Abstract

This academic project, developed in collaboration with **[Yanis stentzel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanis-stentzel/)** and **[Alix Cartal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alix-cartal-18333534b/)**, aims to bridge the gap between external database management and automated web publishing. The application performs three core functions:
1. **API Integration**: Real-time data retrieval from the Brickset database, handling authentication and complex queries (series, year, or set ID).
2. **Collection Management**: A robust terminal-based interface allowing users to add, remove, and track LEGO sets within a local database.
3. **Automated Rendering**: Dynamic generation of HTML/CSS web pages to visualize the collection, including high-resolution imagery and technical specifications for each set.
